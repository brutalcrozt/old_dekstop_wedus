[00:37.21]In the first days
[00:39.02]Of the spring time
[00:40.95][01:11.62]Made you up and split from one thousand enemies
[00:44.80]Made a trail of
[00:46.72]Of a thousand tears
[00:48.58]Made you a prisoner inside your own secrecy

[00:52.62][01:06.53][01:22.99][01:35.11][01:50.70][02:37.21][02:54.17][03:07.18][03:22.53][03:38.85][03:53.63]
[00:53.61][01:24.42][01:39.74][02:25.89][02:41.11][02:56.51][03:11.72][03:27.09][03:42.31]There's a ghost in me
[00:57.22][01:28.21][01:43.47][02:29.49][02:44.90][03:00.43][03:15.51][03:30.75][03:46.09]Who wants to say "I'm sorry"
[01:01.13][01:32.13][01:47.38][02:33.43][02:48.75][03:04.15][03:19.39][03:35.00][03:50.36]Doesn't mean I'm sorry

[01:07.77]At the first hour
[01:09.70]Of the springtime

[01:15.60]Now I see you
[01:17.53]From the corner
[01:19.45]Clock strikes
[01:20.07]And I know you will be drinking alone
