Title: True Stories

Born under punchs, cross eyed and painless
Slippery people, I'm not In Love
Houses In Motion, a Road To Nowhere
Once In A Lifetime, I'm Not In Love
Don't Worry About The Government
The Democratic Circus
Cause Mommy Daddy You and I
Are Burning Down The House
Heeey! Heeeey! Heeeey! Heeey!
Psycho Killer, radiohead
Television Man, I'm Not In Love
Puzzling Evidence, Seen and Not Seen
This Must Be The Place
I'm Not In Love

Don't Worry 'Bout The Government
The Democratic Circus
Cause Mommy Daddy You and I
Are Burning Down The House
I Get wild, Wild Gravity
Wild Wild Life, The Big Country
Don't Worry 'Bout The Government
The Democratic Circus
Cause Mommy Daddy You and I
Are Burning Down The House
I Get Wild, Wild Gravity
Wild Wild Life, The Big Country
