/*

This macro demonstrates the speed of the FindImagePos command.  

Run it and browse for a bitmap file previously created with the Image Capture tool which is
currently showing on the screen.  Hit Find and the image will be found, the mouse will move
to it's location and a message box will be displayed showing elapsed time in seconds.
